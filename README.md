# confusion-matrix-evaluation
 A project demonstrating the evaluation of a classification model using confusion matrices and key performance metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. This repository includes manual calculations, comparisons with Scikit-learn's built-in functions, and a visualization of the confusion matrix. Organized in a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and reproducibility.
