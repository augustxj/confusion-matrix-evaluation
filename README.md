# Model Evaluation Metrics - A Hands-On Comparison

This project demonstrates the calculation and comparison of classification model evaluation metrics, offering a hands-on approach to understand their computation and usage in machine learning workflows. The notebook is designed to be educational and compares manual implementations with scikit-learn's built-in metrics.

## Objectives

1. **Understand Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Explore key metrics like Precision, Recall, Specificity, F1-Score, and Accuracy.
   - Learn how these metrics help assess the performance of classification models.

2. **Manual Implementation**:
   - Implement the metrics from scratch using Python.
   - Gain insights into their mathematical foundations and practical significance.

3. **Comparison with scikit-learn**:
   - Verify the manual implementations by comparing them with scikit-learn's built-in functions.
   - Highlight the equivalence and potential discrepancies in calculations.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Synthetic Dataset Generation**:
   - A classification dataset is created using `make_classification` from scikit-learn.

2. **Model Training**:
   - An XGBoost classifier is trained on the dataset, and predictions are made on the test set.

3. **Confusion Matrix Visualization**:
   - A confusion matrix is generated and visualized to understand model performance.

4. **Manual Metric Calculations**:
   - Functions for metrics (e.g., `accuracy`, `precision`, `recall`, `specificity`, `f1-score`) are defined and applied to the model's predictions.

5. **Comparison with scikit-learn**:
   - The manually computed metrics are compared against those calculated using scikit-learn's `classification_report`.

6. **Result Presentation**:
   - Metrics are displayed in a Pandas DataFrame and visualized for clear interpretation.

## Key Features

- **Didactic Approach**: Step-by-step explanations accompany code blocks to enhance understanding.
- **Visualization**: Results are visualized to make the comparisons intuitive.
- **Practical Insights**: Demonstrates real-world relevance by simulating a classification problem.
